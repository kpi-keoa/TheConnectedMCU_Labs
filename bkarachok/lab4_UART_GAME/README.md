In this laboratory work, a program was developed in the form of the game "Guess a Number". The UART interface is used to transfer data between the program and the board. To communicate with the program, the terminal emulator on the UART PC is used on the chipKIT Wi-FIRE board. It is necessary to guess the number in the range from 0 to 10, which each time is defined by the function rand(). Only 3 attempts are allowed. For each attempt, the program will respond: YES (if the number is guessed right), too high (if the number is greater), too low (if the number is less). If the number was correct, the winning count is increased by 1. If the number is guessed incorrectly or not guessed 3 times, the counter of the losses is increased by 1. If the win count reaches 5, a message is displayed that the jackpot has been won. If the counter of the losses has reached the value 5, messages are displayed that the jackpot is not won. When you enter 11, the win and loss counters are reset to zero.
