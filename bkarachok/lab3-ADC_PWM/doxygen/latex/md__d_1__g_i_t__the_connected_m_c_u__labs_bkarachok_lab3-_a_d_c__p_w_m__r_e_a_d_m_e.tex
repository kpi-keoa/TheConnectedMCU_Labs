In this laboratory work, a program was developed to control the brightness of the L\+ED using a potentiometer on Wi\+Fire board and using external voltage regilator -\/ microphone. Turning the potentiometer knob changes the voltage that is applied to the analog port. Under the influence of sound signals and noise, the microphone changes the voltage value. The choice of the desired voltage regulator is made by changing the value of the M\+O\+DE variable in the file \hyperlink{user_8c}{user.\+c}. Voltage is measured by the A\+DC. The timer generates a P\+WM signal whose duty cycle varies depending on the measured voltage. Thus, the brightness of the L\+ED is changed by turning the potentiometer knob or by making noise near microphone. The display of the brightness level with three L\+E\+Ds was realized\+: a low level -\/ one L\+ED is on, an average level is 2, high is 3. Indication occurs only when the B\+T\+N1 button is pressed and held.
