In this lab work, a graphic editor is implemented using the OLED display, buttons, a switch on the chipkit WiFire Basic I/0 Shield board, and data transfer via the SPI interface.
At the beginning of the program, the text is displayed and the initial coordinates for drawing are set. Using the buttons, you can move 1 pixel up, down, right or left. With the switch, the pixel color is set to black or white.
