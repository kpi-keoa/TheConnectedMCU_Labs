## About
Tug-of-war game. The burning LEDs indicate the position of the center of the rope. The team that pulled the rope wins. Victory is symbolized by running lights. The advantage of this code is that the processing of keystrokes occurs through interrupts, which minimizes the ability to skip pressing a button.
Also the mode of inversion of burning LEDs is added. That is, the luminous LEDs do not glow, and on a turn. And the game mode without user intervention.

The project was written and tested on a microcontroller `PIC32MZ2048ECG100`.
