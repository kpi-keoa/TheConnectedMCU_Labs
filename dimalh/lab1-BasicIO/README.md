lab1-BasicIO is a simple laboratory project for PIC32 WiFire kit written in C language for studying configuring and using GPIO of microcontroller. The program uses 4 onboard LEDs for blinking and 2 onboard Buttons for pressing. You have 3 variant to choose one of the mode.  By pressing first button, you can see, that LED_1 switch on for short period and after that star mode_1(LED_1 and LED_3 switch on for long period). By pressing second button, you can see, that LED_2 switch on for short period and after that star mode_1(LED_2 and LED_4 switch on for long period). By pressing both buttons, you can see, that LED_3 and LED_4 switch on for short period and after that star mode_1(all LEDs switch on for long period).
