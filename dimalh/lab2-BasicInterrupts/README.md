lab2-BasicInterrupts is a university laboratory project for PIC32 WiFire kit written in C language for studying basic usage of interrupts of microcontroller.

In program you can add two numbers. Using BTN1 you can increment counter(every click BTN1 you will increase counter. If counter is equal 15, so counter will change to 0). Value of counter is shown in binary format, which represent in combinations of four LEDs(LED_1 = 2^0, LED_2 = 2^1, LED_3 = 2^2, LED_4 = 2^3). Using BTN2 you can safe current value of counter in variables and sum up this variables (first and second pressing BTN2, you will safe current value of counter in two differents variables, like number_save_1 and number_save_2, and third press BTN2 you will sum up number_save_1 and number_save_2). After that, you will see result, which represent on LED1-LED4.
