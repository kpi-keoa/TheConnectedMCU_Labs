## About

Project for PIC32 microcontroller. Program uses 2 onboard leds to display morse code encoded message. Brightness of leds could be controlled with potentiometer.

Timer is used [PWM](https://soundcloud.com/chikujii/lil-wayne-pussy-money-weed-pmw) mode and ADC to read value from potentiometer. 

The project was written and tested on a microcontrollers `PIC32MZ2048ECG100` and `PIC32MZ2048EFG100`.

## Build

To build this project you need [XC32](http://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers) compiler.
