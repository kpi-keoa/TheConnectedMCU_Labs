In the introduction to peripheral equipment, I learned how to initialize inputs and outputs and manage them in the new MIPS architecture. 
In this lab I edited parts of the code, for flashing or controlling the LED, with the control button.
Etc I made code more comfort by using #define. 
I got experience with the chipKIT debuging board.
