In this lab I wrote code to controll the LEDs on the board with buttons.
Button 1 makes "ON" LED go to the right and button 2 in oposite direction.
When the number of blinking diod "overflows" the number of diods, it goes to the oposite side.
After pressing both buttons chenghes the frequency of blinking LED.
