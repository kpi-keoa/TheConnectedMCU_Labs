In this lab I wrote code to play the tug-of-war game. At start, program sets leds to 0110 position.
After button press the position changes towards one of players. If middle of rope reaches edge, corresponding player wins.
Leds starts moving towards the winner and shows him. If after this moment both buttons are pressed, the game will restart.
